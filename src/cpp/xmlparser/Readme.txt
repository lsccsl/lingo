XML Parse Lib - A set of routines for parsing and generating XML.

For Documentation and Usage Notes, see:
	http://xmlparselib.sourceforge.net/

Files:
  Readme.txt - This file.
  xml_parse_lib.h - Headers.  (Structures, data-types, & routine prototypes.)
  xml_parse_lib.c - Core XML-parsing functions.
  unit_convertors.c - Convenience routines for accepting, checking, or
			converting common units.
  xml_xsd_checker.c - Preliminary schema checker.

A directory of tests and examples is included under "tests_and_examples":
  app.c  - Simple stream-oriented (parse as-you-go) XML file reader
	   application.
  test_general_parser.c  - Reads XML-files into XML-tree and writes 
	   them back out from tree.
  test_general_xml_generator.c  - Generates XML files for testing.
  test_xml_token_traverser.c - Example of traversing an xml-tree, after
	   reading an xml-file into xml-tree.

Instructions for compiling and running the tests/examples are included
within the comment header of each program.

Public Low-level functions:
   xml_parse( fileptr, tag, content, maxlen, linenum );
   xml_grab_tag_name( tag, name, maxlen );
   xml_grab_attrib( tag, name, value, maxlen );
Public Higher-level functions:
   Xml_Read_File( filename );
   Xml_Write_File( filename, xml_tree );

Throughout this library, all text and program source files assume tabs 
are 8-spaces.
